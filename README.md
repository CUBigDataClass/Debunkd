# Tackling misinformation with Big Data
## A project by Team Swashbucklers for ATLS 5214
### University of Colorado Boulder

This project aims to highlight the spread of misinformation through social media by using Map and graph-based visualizations 
to gain insight into how misinformation spreads across the internet. We shall be using Twitter to conduct our experiments.

How it works
-----------------------

Our aim is to track the spread of false news and hoaxes by using fact-checking websites such as Snopes, PolitiFact and 
FactCheck.
