# Tackling Misinformation with Big Data
## A project by Team Swashbucklers for ATLS 5214 @ CU Boulder

#### Introduction

This project aims to highlight the spread of misinformation through social media by using Map and graph-based visualizations 
to gain insight into how misinformation spreads across the internet. We shall be using Twitter to conduct our experiments.

#### How it works

Our aim is to track the spread of false news and hoaxes by using fact-checking websites such as Snopes, PolitiFact and 
FactCheck.

#### RoadMap
- [x] Get Factchecking Links from Websites(Snopes for now)
- [x] Get list of corresponding tweets from Twitter(Using GNIP).
- [x] Map visualization to show the distributions of the hoax
- [x] Time series visualization to show timeline of the spread of the hoax
- [ ] Graph visualization to show how Hoax spreads across news.
